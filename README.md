## Projects

### Handwritten Digit Classifier
[Github](https://github.com/AlexLuna4/Handwritten_Digit_Recognizer_UI.git)

Employing the 'MNIST' dataset, I developed a deep-layer neural network to classify digits from 0 to 9 using PyTorch for educational purposes. 
The comprehensive documentation covers the entire algorithm development process, including dataset acquisition, model design, training, validation, and model deployment. 
This serves to showcase every stage of the machine learning model development cycle, hosted as a web application in the cloud of Hugging Face Spaces.

### Virtual Clinical Assistant for the monitoring of diabetes mellitus:

Developed using Python and the GPT-3.5 model API from OpenAI, alongside a Mexican clinical practice guideline. Deployed using Streamlit and github spaces. 
Aims to expedite diabetes diagnosis by providing physicians with prompt-based patient follow-up and treatment guidance based on clinically validated information.
