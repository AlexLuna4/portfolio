## Projects

### Handwritten Digit Classifier
[Github](https://github.com/AlexLuna4/Handwritten_Digit_Recognizer_UI.git)

Employing the 'MNIST' dataset, I developed a deep-layer neural network to classify digits from 0 to 9 using PyTorch for educational purposes. 
The comprehensive documentation covers the entire algorithm development process, including dataset acquisition, model design, training, validation, and model deployment. 
This serves to showcase every stage of the machine learning model development cycle, hosted as a web application in the cloud of Hugging Face Spaces.

### Virtual Clinical Assistant for the monitoring of diabetes mellitus:
[Github](https://github.com/AlexLuna4/Virtual_Clinical_Assistant_GPT.git)

Using Python, a clinical assistant chatbot was developed using the GPT-3.5 model API from OpenAI and one of the Mexican clinical practice guidelines used for monitoring Diabetes Mellitus in healthcare services. 
The model was deployed using Streamlit, a web application development framework. The project's intention is to provide a virtual assistant capable of utilizing clinically validated information, 
streamlining the diagnosis process for diabetes. This avoids the need for the physician to review each case in the clinical guideline manually. With just a prompt, 
they can determine how to manage patient diagnosis and treatment.
